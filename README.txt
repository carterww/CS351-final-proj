System Requirements:
Java SE 14 or newer (only tested on 14 and 15)

Installation/Configuration:
Set url to database and database name in com.groupten.data.DependentVars to their respective values for the database
being used. Also, our MYSQL database dump will be included in the resources folder, so it can be created to have the
existing users and data in the database. That is all the setup required, now the main class in the src file can be
compiled and run. Or the application can be used to create an executable jar file.

The ConnectorJ jar dependency is included in the libs folder, so there is no need to set the directory. If the ConnectorJ
is not working, check the CS351FinalProject.iml file under <CLASSES> for the directory ConnectorJ is set to.
