The usernames, passwords, and privileges can be adjusted in the users.sql file, but these are the defaults.

System Requirements:
Java SE 14 or newer (only tested on 14 and 15)
MYSQL DBMS
Java IDE or Shell/Terminal/Command Prompt (however you prefer to run Java programs)
  - For IDE we recommend IntelliJ or Eclipse

Installation/Configuration:

Creating the database:
1) In mySQL workbench: Import/Open the database dump file, 'grouptendump.sql' and run it to add the tables to your database.
	- This defaults the database name to 'groupten' as well.
	- Located in the 'resources' folder
2) Similarly, import/open the 'users.sql' file in mySQL workbench to import the user privileges.
	- Located in the 'resources' folder
3) Now the database can be used for this application. If implemented correctly, representatives will be able to login and
   execute queries as well as the application being able to access the tables.


Configuring the Java Application:
** Import the extracted zip into the IDE you are using.
1) Access the class: src/com.groupten/data/DependentVars and change the url and database name to their respective values for your database.
   - 'groupten' is default in our program but can be changed...
   - If the database name is not 'groupten' and the 'users.sql' file was not adjusted prior to execution, then the 'users.sql' file will not grant users priveleges and they cannot login.

2) A classpath must be set to the connectorj.jar file located in the 'lib' folder. This can be done easily through an
   IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ (.iml file has classpath so if running in IntelliJ, this step shouldn't be required.
   - See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-jar-file-to-classpath-in-java/ for more information
   - Your IDE likely has a way to do this, so search how to add a classpath to a jar file for your IDE.
   â€“ If you are not using an IDE, and running through 'java' command in terminal, enter -classpath "..\libs\connectorj.jar;"
     as an argument.
   - For these reasons we recommend using IntelliJ and Eclipse because the classpath is already set in the .iml file provided.
3) Run the Main class in 'src/com.groupten/app/Main' to start the application!

Common Problems:
If setup is done incorrectly, these are some common issues and fixes.

- Unable to login. No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/groupten
  This means your classpath to the connectorj.jar file provided in the 'lib' folder is not set up properly. There are many
  ways this can be fixed listed in number 2 of section 'Configuring the Java Application.' If it is still not working,
  check https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-binary-installation.html out for additional help.

- Cannot login as a representative.
  If the users.sql file was not executed, the existing users will not be able to login. Make sure you ran the file as a
  root user or root equivalent user.

- Cannot create a user after adding a representative.
  This means a representative was added to the rep table, but no user was added to login as. This stems from the task
  being run as a user with no CREATE USER or GRANT privileges. Make sure you logged into the database as a representative
  or root user.
